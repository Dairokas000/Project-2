    <p>The Last of Us is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, 
        Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective. Players use firearms and improvised weapons and can use stealth to
         defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus. In the online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative
          and competitive gameplay. In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and short-range weapons such as a handgun and a 
          short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies.
           The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as health kits, shivs, and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting
            speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged by finding edible items or through the use of health kits. Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. "Listen Mode" allows the player to 
            locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the dynamic cover system, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters.
         The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu. The game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, 
         they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage of the player when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.

    <h2><u><em>Reviews</em></u></h2>
    <br>
    <p>The original The Last of Us will always be my favourite PlayStation game. The narrative is amazing, the relationship between Joel and Ellie
         is wholesome and it all culminates into a satisfying story that will bring tears to your eyes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The overall zombie/post-apocalyptic/infected/dystopian story may be somewhat trite, yet that doesn't halt The Last of Us 
        from being one of the best and most cinematic video game experiences ever.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Leave it to a video game to produce the greatest zombie story since George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. Yes, the story is great. Yes, the voice acting is great. 
        Yes, you get emotionally involved with the characters and everything that happens to them. With that said, though, The Last of Us is more than just a well-told story,
         it could very well be a sign of where the genre is headed, and if that's the case then colour me excited.

    <p>I rate a ton of things on this site all the time, but I've never done an actual review. The Last of Us more than warrants one. I've never had a gaming experience quite like it. It transcends an average game.

        The story is the meat and potatoes of this game. It will grab you in the opening scene and hold you throughout. You will come to care a lot about the characters and their struggles in this post-apocalyptic world. 
        This game also contains some of the darkest topics ever touched by gaming. I won't go into any of them but know that it was a bold move and it paid off. 
        Note that this game truly earns its M rating and is not for everyone.

    <p>Holy moly quacamolely! I think I've found a game that is better than mostly all TV and film alike. Just...where do I start? I was made aware of this game a long time ago when it first came out, and I always knew it had stellar reviews, so I did buy the Grounded version and DLC package in 2015. Thing is- I never had the time to sit down and play it, because I'm the kind of person who likes to start and finish a game in one sitting. 
        So since I could never find the time, it always just sat on my shelf collecting dust. Flash forward to 2020, inside quarentine and have nothing to do but watch and or play everything I already haven't. 
        I was going through my video game collection and I remembered about the game, so I popped it into my PlayStation to play.
        About 12 hours later I was sobbing in my seat. I just can't start, other than saying, this game is a masterpiece! A genuine masterpiece. I'm not saying its better than most TV and Film, but I'm saying its SUPERIOR!

        I know this has almost become clich√©d on IMDb but the greatness of this game has indeed caused me to write my first and only review. The Last Of Us is a unique game which captures the fragility of our social structure and demonstrates the brutality that some people are capable of. 
        Don't pay any attention to nonsensical reviews by critics such as Polygon's Phillip Kollar who argues criticisms such as 'the game isn't fun' as it was never meant to be.
         The world that the game is based in isn't fun and this has been further emphasised by every trailer and demo that had been revealed prior to game's release. 
         When playing on normal i felt like almost every encounter could be my last and i was equally terrified by the fact that Naughty Dog wouldn't hold back in showing just what the consequences of failure are.
          The game rather than focusing on horror revolves around the relationship between Joel and Ellie and this is masterfully complimented by the score which was composed by two-time Oscar Award winner, Gustavo Santaolalla.
