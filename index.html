        <h3>The Last Of Us</h3>
        <h5><u>Developed by Naughty Dog</u></h5>
        <p>This game was one of the first games that I played on my PS5 when I got it for christmas. 
        It holds a special place in my heart because of this. And by the time I finish the game, I found my self wanting to play it again.
        I played this game like five seperate times before finally getting another game to play.
    The story is top-tier, the gameplay is top-tier, the characters are top-tier, the whole game is top-tier.
    It's really sad though, and the ending is really good. The thing that I think that seperates this "zombie" type
game from others is the fact that it's not all jump scares and scary. This game offers more to it's playes than jumpscares, it offers story, 
amazing gameplay, and amazing enviroment. Also the way that this game makes you feel while playing it, you get
invested with the characters. One of my favorite games by far.</p>

    <p>This game was the most recent "zombie game that I played. The story was so long, like 40 hours, but it was 
        worth it in the end. The best thing I like in this story is the open-world part of it. It is so cool,
        like it feels like I'm literally in the game world. Another thing I like about this game is that there's something
        called "hordes". In the opeen-world (and only three times in the main story), there's these roaming groups of zombies, and like in each group
        there's about 100 to 500 zombies depending on the size. They are soooo hard to kill, like it's crazy how hard
        the hordes are. I only killed like 6 or 7, and there's like 100 hordes in the game.
