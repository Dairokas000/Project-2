        <p>Days Gone is a 2019 action-adventure video game developed by Bend Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4.
             A Windows port was released in May 2021. The game is set in post-apocalyptic Oregon two years after the start of a pandemic that turned a portion of humanity into vicious zombie-like creatures. 
             Former outlaw-turned-drifter Deacon St. John discovers his wife Sarah, having been assumed dead, may still be alive and goes on a quest to find her. Days Gone is played from a third-person perspective in which the player can explore an open world environment. 
             Players can use firearms, melee weapons, and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend themselves against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures known as Freakers. A major game mechanic is Deacon's motorcycle, which is used as the player character's main mode of transportation. Days Gone is a third-person action-adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic open world. 
             The player controls Deacon St. John, an outlaw-turned-drifter-bounty-hunter who prefers life on the road to wilderness encampments. The game takes place two years after a pandemic killed almost all of humanity and transformed millions of others into "Freakers", mindless, zombie-like creatures that evolve quickly. Swarmers, a nocturnal type of Freaker, hide in their nests during daytime but often congregate, wander around, and search for food and water at night. 
             Players can lure Swarmers toward other enemies, causing the two groups to fight one another. Other enemies include Newts, who are infected adolescents and opportunistic hunters who only attack Deacon when he enters their territory or has poor health. The game includes infected wildlife (called Runners and Ragers) and hostile human enemies. Players can be overwhelmed by hordes and must keep their distance. Deacon can use firearms, melee weapons, traps, 
             explosives and choke points to kill Freakers. The game is set in an open world in the Pacific Northwest. Players can freely explore the world on foot or using a motorcycle. The bike consumes fuel and becomes disabled if excessively damaged. Players must regularly refuel the bike at gas stations and camps, and repair it using collected scraps. Deacon must establish trust with settlement camps and earn "camp credits" by completing missions, and by completing bounties and selling food. As the level of trust increases, players can purchase new weapons, supplies and motorcycle parts that can be used to enhance its speed, 
             durability and maneuverability. The bike's appearance can be customized. As players explore the world, they must collect valuable resources and components for crafting weapons and supplies. In addition to the main quests, the game has a number of side objectives, which include clearing Freaker nests, rescuing hostages, clearing enemy camps, capturing bounty targets, and restoring power to National Emergency Response Organization (NERO) checkpoints. Inside NERO checkpoints, players can use NERO injectors to boost Deacon's health; stamina, used when Deacon is sprinting or dodging; and focus, which allows Deacon to temporarily slow down time while aiming his ranged weapons.
              Fast travel consumes fuel and causes time to pass. Before players can fast travel, they must destroy all Freaker nests between the two fast travel points. As players complete missions and objectives, they gain experience points (XP). With sufficient XP, players can level up and unlock new abilities, allowing them to increase the efficiency of Deacon's melee weapons and ranged weapons, and to enhance his survival skills.

            An epic adventure, riveting story, graphics, sound, music and effects to another level for its time, a masterpiece of the gaming industry, literally pulls the user like a whirlwind into its lively and dangerous post-apocalyptic world, rendering Deacon St John’s and the rest of the survivors’ struggle to survive and regain their world (or perhaps our world?) from the freaks in the best way by making him (the player) an active participant in the events and conflicts that are created unintentionally or by the parallel actions of people who despite the catastrophe that has fallen on them and the daily danger they face, they continue to act on the basis of their personal interests, 
            obsessions or malicious intentions as if nothing has changed.

            From beginning to end it is a heartwarming, gut-wrenching and epic story without compare, it's almost like I can feel everything Deacon feels all the way through, 
            his struggles, his frustration, his pain and his joy... It all feels real in a way that no other game does.

            I have just finished my playthrough of this game, took me a few weeks due to working full time and having a 2 year old, but Wow! What an experience! An immersive experience with a great base storyline that I never felt too detached from while exploring the world, completing side quests and gathering bounties to increase my camp points. There is nothing quite like the heart pounding experience of facing a hoard of cooked units, whether it be on purpose, for a mission or sliding out at night and hitting a tree right in front of a nesting ground and scrambling for my life to either get back on the bike or make a final stand! The developers in my opinion absolutely nailed this amazing and fulfilling game and I'm grateful to them for providing me with a world that sucked me right in! 
            A definite must for those who might be questioning whether to play or not

            I am hooked on this game.  The acting and characters are endearing, the challenge of finding hordes and taking them on is scary and fun, 
             doing burnouts/donuts on your fully customizable motorcycle is fun.  It's just a great game.  A solid 4/5 at least.  
             The side missions never feel repetitive because there are many ways to tackle them and new elements are introduced (e.g new infected animals,  weapons) and the locations are so varied, plus you usually unlock cool things,  
             not like games like say Fallout 4 minutemen where you save the same old chumps repeatedly. The female characters are strong and interesting which gives it a cool factor for me.The emotions between characters feels real.
